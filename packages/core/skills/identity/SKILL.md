# /my-agent:identity

Re-run the identity setup step. Updates your name, purpose, and key contacts.

When the user types `/my-agent:identity`, this launches an interactive Q&A that writes to `brain/memory/core/identity.md` and optionally `brain/memory/core/contacts.md`.

This command can be run at any time to update identity information.
